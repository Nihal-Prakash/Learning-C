hello what are doing? I am trying to make my code work
but what the heck it wont work at all .... ugh - wait if you
can read this then it's probably working , finally after like 23 tries

I have always been fascinated by code.
As a kid, I would spend hours trying to
figure out how video games worked.
I would disassemble them, looking for the
hidden secrets.

But it wasn't until college,
when I took my first programming class,
that I truly fell in love with code.

We started with C,
the most basic of programming languages.
It was like learning how to
speak a new language.
At first, it was hard and frustrating.
But as I progressed,
I began to understand the logic
behind the code.

I was fascinated by how
everything was broken down
into little pieces.

It was like playing with lego blocks.
You could build anything
if you had the right combination.

But what really captured my heart
was the power of code.

It was like a superhero's suit.
With it, you could do anything.
You could create worlds
or solve complex problems.

It was like having a superpower.

As I continued on my journey,
I encountered many obstacles.
There were times when I
would get stuck on a problem
for hours.

But I never gave up.
I kept pushing,
keeping my eyes on the prize.

And little by little,
I began to see the light.

It was like a puzzle coming
together.

I started to understand
how the pieces fit together.

And when it all came together,
it was like a dream.

It was like seeing the world
in a whole new way.

I knew that I had found
my calling.

I wanted to be a master
of code.

I wanted to be able to
create worlds,
solve problems,
and make a difference.

I knew that the world
needed people like me.

I knew that I had the
power to change it.

And I was ready to take
on the challenge.
